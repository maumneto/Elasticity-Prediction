# Elasticity-Prediction
Elasticity Prediction Code 

# Presentation
Hello everyone! This code is made by @maumneto that implements some prediction methods in Elasticity data base. The code was implemented in R language (using Rstudio as IDE). This project are modularized, i.e., each script is performing a function in the main code.

# An implementations list follows:
- Elasticity data base - node-a.log and node-b.log;
- Some metrics of prediction errors - ErrorFunction.R;
- Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model implementation - ARIMAmodel.R;
- ExponenTial Smoothing (ETS) model implementation - ETSmodel.R;
- Code that capts elasticity data from the nodes (node-a/b) - ElasticityData.R;
- Code test - ForecastMethodsForElasticity.R;
